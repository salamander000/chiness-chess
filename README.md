# chinese-chess-project
 My school project about chinese chess using Minimax Algorithm/Alpha-Beta Algorithm.
Before using this, please read this properly else there will be some error(s).
After cloned/downloaded this file, open it and do a few changes:

- First, download Python 3.11 because the "tensorflow" can't be download, then check that you have downloaded every library to run.

- Second, checking all the main file(s) with .py because this project runs by scanning all files inside this file to check the training algorithm and the pieces of the game, so the directory should be your directory not mine.
 
- Finally, I don't have the PvP mode so you can only play with AI, so if you are finding this, I'm truly sorry :)
Enjoy this as the level of a student, don't be too hard with it, just use this as a reference for your own project, improve it if you can, and email me if you did :)
